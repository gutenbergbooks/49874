<h2><a name="THE_GREEN_FLAG_OF_THE_PROPHET" id="THE_GREEN_FLAG_OF_THE_PROPHET">THE GREEN FLAG OF THE PROPHET.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> the commencement of the war between
Russia and Turkey, the world has several times
been startled by the announcement that the 'Flag
of the Prophet' was about to be unfurled in the
streets of Stamboul. Such an event, if it should
happen (which may heaven avert), would proclaim
a crusade in which all true Mussulmans would be
bound to take an active part, and to fight against
Christianity in every part of the world. They may
be in India, Arabia, Egypt, or wherever else their
scattered race has found a home; the raising of the
green standard is a call which none may disobey
without, as the Koran lays it down, sacrificing all
his hopes of Paradise.</p>

<p>This fearful appeal to all the worst passions of
the Eastern races hangs like a menace over the
Mohammedan world; and if the word was once
uttered and the dread flag unfurled, there is no
telling to what sanguinary excesses it might lead
an enthusiastic and half-savage people. It may be
of interest to our readers if, under these circumstances,
we endeavour to make them acquainted
with the origin and history of a banner which has
not seen the light of day since the Empress Catharine
of Russia attempted to reinstate Christianity
in the City of the Sultans, and which once unfurled,
would set a whole world ablaze.</p>

<p>There have been many flags or signals used by
various nations at different crises in their history
to incite the peoples to battle on behalf of religions,
dynasties, and ideas; but none has attained
to the fearful notoriety which appertains to the
terrible Flag of the Prophet, which is really a
banner of blood, for it dispels the idea of mercy
from the minds and hearts of its followers, and
gives no quarter to man, woman, or child.</p>

<p>The Red Cross banner of the Christian Crusaders
was an emblem of chivalry, mercy, gentleness, and
love; but under its folds many a dark deed and
many a shameless act were committed; and it was
understood by the members of the Mohammedan
faith to mean nothing less than the utter extermination
of their race. This feeling, with its consequent
hatred of Christianity, shews itself even at
this advanced period in the world's history, by the
recent refusal of the Turkish government to allow
its ambulance corps and hospitals to bear the red
cross of the Geneva Convention (a sign which is
entirely neutral, and is designed to protect its
wearers while they are engaged on their errands of
mercy to the sick and wounded of both sides),
adopting instead thereof their own emblem of the
crescent. Thus we see these rival emblems once
more waving over the field of battle, though, happily,
to mitigate rather than increase the horrors
of war.</p>

<p>In France the 'oriflamme' or golden sun upon
a field of crimson signified 'no quarter;' but this
celebrated Flag of the Prophet means infinitely
more than this. It is a summons to an anti-Christian
crusade, a challenge of every believer
in the Prophet to arms; a war-signal in fact,
which, like the Fiery Cross of Scotland, would
flash its dread command through the domain of
Islam. In the interests of humanity, however, we
may hope that the 'Commander of the Faithful'
will never utter the dreadful word; for then
indeed would the whole soul and strength of
Christendom turn against the enemy of all civilised
laws, human and divine.</p>

<p>The Prophet himself predicted that one day
when his followers should number a hundred
millions&mdash;which they do now, with twenty millions
more added to it&mdash;his flag should fly against the
advancing power of the northern races; and the
Koran or Mohammedan Bible says that when its
silken folds are flung forth 'the earth will shake,
the mountains melt into dust, the seas blaze up
in fire, and the children's hair grow white with
anguish.' This language is of course metaphorical;
but it is easy to conceive, by the light of very
recent history, that some such catastrophe might
take place, as the displaying of this terrible
symbol would raise a frenzy of fanaticism in the
breasts of the Mohammedan race all over the
globe.</p>

<p>The origin of the insignia is a curious one.
Mohammed gazing out upon a vast prospect of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">{610}</a></span>
fields, said: 'Nature is green, and green shall be
my emblem, for it is everlasting and universal.'
In course of time, however, it lost that innocent
significance; and amid his visions, the great
dreamer saw the Green Flag floating as a sign that
all true believers should take up their arms and
march against the Infidel; in fact the green
turban was the sacred head-dress of the pilgrim
or perfected Islamite who had gone to Mecca; and
hence the sanctity of this formidable standard.</p>

<p>When once unfurled, it summons all Islam by
an adjuration from the Koran that the sword is
the solitary emblem and instrument of faith, independence,
and patriotism; that armies, not priests,
make converts; and that sharpened steel is the
'true key to heaven or hell.' Upon that fearful
ensign are inserted the words which are supposed
to have been written at Mecca itself&mdash;namely,
'All who draw it [the sword] will be rewarded
with temporal advantages; every drop shed of
their blood, every peril and hardship endured by
them, will be registered on high as more meritorious
than either fasting or praying. If they fall
in battle, their sins will be at once blotted out,
and they will be transported to Paradise, there
to revel in eternal pleasures in the arms of black-eyed
houris. But for the first heaven are reserved
those of the Faithful who die within sight of
the Green Flag of the Prophet.' Then follow
the terrible and all-significant words, the fearful
war-cry against God and man: 'Then may no
man give or expect mercy!'</p>

<p>This is the outburst of barbarism with which
the world is threatened in this year of grace 1877;
and the reader cannot do otherwise than mark the
cunning nature of the portentous words inscribed
on the Prophet's banner. What would not most
men do, civilised or savage, for 'temporal advantages?'
While to the Eastern peoples fasting and
praying are looked upon as of so meritorious a
nature, that to find something else which, in the
eyes of Allah, would be deemed of greater value
still, would be a desideratum which none would
fail to grasp, by any means whatever, if it came
within their reach. But Mohammed's wonderful
knowledge of human nature, and more especially
of Eastern human nature, is shewn in his picture
of Paradise as prepared for the Faithful who fall
in battle; while his declaration that the highest
heaven in this so-called Paradise will be reserved
for those who die within sight of the Green Flag, is
a masterpiece of devilish policy unequalled in the
annals of mankind.</p>

<p>It scarcely needed the fearful words which
follow to add emphasis to this dreadful appeal to
the passions of a semi-barbarous race. Another
motto on this sacred flag is not without significance
at the present time: 'The gates of Paradise are
under the shade of swords;' and this alone would,
if the flag were unfurled in the holy mosque of
Constantinople, give to the Turk a moral power
over his subordinates the effect of which it would
be vain to calculate. Civilised though he partially
is, he still firmly believes in the old doctrine of
<i>kismet</i> or fatality, and in angels fighting on his
behalf; not less implicitly than did his ancestors
at the battle of Beder, where this formidable green
standard was first unfurled. 'There,' says the
historian, 'they elevated the standard, which
Mohammed from his height in heaven blessed.'</p>

<p>Thus arose the great tradition of this sacred war-emblem,
which it is a Turkish boast was never yet
captured in battle, though it was once in extreme
peril in a fight between hill and plain; when Mohammed
himself had it snatched out of his hands.
Ali, his kinsman, however, thrust himself in front
of a hundred spears, and won the victory with the
immaculate flag flying over his head.</p>

<p>It is scarcely to be wondered at that a race so
superstitious as the Turks should attach an almost
miraculous value to such a symbol of their past
history and their present power. It is a spell
wherever their race or religion flourishes, and its
invocation in the serious form now menaced
cannot be regarded without anxiety. The day of
the military apostles of Mohammed may be past, it
is true; but the tradition survives; and the unfurling
of this flag might be the spark which would
set fire to the latent enthusiasm of the Mohammedan
race and involve the world in a religious
war.</p>

<p>We have referred to the great French banner,
the oriflamme; and it was that which led the
French Crusaders through the Holy Land and
headed the royal armies of France in the
campaigns of the sixteenth century, while it also
divided the Blue from the White in the Burgundian
civil wars; but this Flag of the Prophet
to-day exercises a magical influence over one hundred
and twenty millions of the human race,
scattered about in Arabia, Syria, Asia Minor,
Persia, and Egypt, over the Nile and the Ganges,
and from Jerusalem to the Red Sea.</p>

<p>The desire of Mohammed, however, was, that
while all pilgrims whose task had been duly fulfilled
should wear the green turban, no sovereign
in his succession should unfurl the Green Flag of
the Faith unless Islam were in imminent peril.
The unfurling of the banner would be performed
with great religious ceremony, and in the presence
of the Commander of the Faithful, who is himself
supposed to carry it at the head of his army;
while a fearful curse would be called down upon
the head of every Mohammedan who, capable of
bearing arms, failed to rally round it.</p>

<p>The standard itself is not a very handsome one,
and is surpassed both in value and appearance by
many of the banners which belong to the various
benefit societies and other mutual associations of
men in this country. It is of green silk, with a
large crescent on the top of the staff, from which
is suspended a long plume of horse-hair (said to
have been the tail of the Prophet's favourite Arab
steed), while the broad folds of the flag exhibit
the crescent and the quotations from the Koran
already mentioned.</p>

<p>The state colour of one of our regiments of the
Guards is a much prettier and more expensive
standard than the great banner of Islam; but (to
such small things is man's enthusiasm attached) if
the latter was the veriest 'rag' in existence, nothing
could mar the beauty which the prestige of more
than a thousand years has given to it in the eyes
of a Mussulman.</p>

<p>The Flag of the Prophet is kept in the mosque<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">{611}</a></span>
of St Sophia at Constantinople, and is in the
custody of the Sheik-ul-Islam, or Mohammedan
chief-priest, where all well-wishers of humanity
may sincerely trust it will ever remain.</p>

<h3>PART II.</h3>


<h4>CHAPTER THE SEVENTH.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Deborah</span> and Mistress Dinnage were walking in
the old garden, in the moonlight, on the mossed
green walk along which they had played hound
and hare in 'madder merrier days.' They walked
slowly, arm in arm, talking plentifully and
earnestly, and still the old difference shewed between
them. Deborah, so cold with most of
her own sex, and so wont to accept passively
their enthusiastic tokens of affection and admiration,
dealt only the most caressing tenderness to
Margaret Dinnage; which Mistress Dinnage, on
her part, returned with brusqueness and no outward
show of affection whatever.</p>

<p>'I made him take it,' said Deborah. 'I know
not what sore trouble had got hold of him. I
think it was worse than need of money, or a
greater debt than he has ever had before.'</p>

<p>'And he has gone to Master Sinclair? O Lady
Deb, you should have made him see Sir Vincent
first; though, good sooth, it is easier to preach
than to practise, and it is no light task for ye to
lead Master Fleming. But I, like you, abominate
that old man. Whenever he rides up the chase, I
say to father: "Father, the old fox comes! He
wishes no good to Enderby."'</p>

<p>'I know it well; more strongly my heart tells
me so each time. He comes for poor Deb Fleming;
but time and coldness will soon unearth his cunning,
and turn his hateful love to cruel hate.'</p>

<p>'Ay, and he will urge your brother on to ruin,
in hopes of winning you.'</p>

<p>'O Mistress Dinnage, good Mistress Dinnage, say
not so, so coldly! Sweet heart, how could this
thing be? Marry the man who compassed my
brother's ruin? You speak wisely!'</p>

<p>'Ah,' said Mistress Dinnage scornfully, 'you
are blind; but I, shut out from all great folk's
doings, can see and know them well. I can see
how Master Sinclair, that old fox, would bring you
and yours to <i>beggary</i>&mdash;ay, to shame&mdash;that he may
say to ye: "Wed me; I will save your father and
brother." <i>He</i> knows your love for them. <i>He</i>
knows o' what stuff you're made. And indeed
you'd be sore pressed between your love for them
and your hate for Master Sinclair.'</p>

<p>'O Meg, say no more. You wrong me. I had
rather see them <i>dead</i>. But what can I do? The
swiftest horse would not catch Charlie now. O
Mistress Dinnage, you have scared me, and I am
not wont to be scared. What if Adam Sinclair
drives him mad? gives him some great sum, and
then has him up to pay it! No; stay! Charlie is
not of age. But worse, if he refuses aid, and my
poor boy flies the country. O merciful heaven!'
Deborah stood with her hands clasped upon her
head, and her eyes regarding Mistress Dinnage
wildly.</p>

<p>'No,' said Mistress Dinnage thoughtfully; 'this
will not be. If Master Fleming is in debt, old
Adam Sinclair will give him the money needful,
and draw him on and on; for the time's not come
yet. Lady Deb, you must talk to him&mdash;to Master
Fleming. You alone can save him, an' it's a
down road he's goin'. If father hadn't spared the
rod so oft, an' we hadn't screened him so oft from
blame, this thing might not be. But that is
past. If ye will save Master Fleming from utter
ruin, <i>now</i> is the time.'</p>

<p>'Ay, you talk,' said Deborah scornfully; 'you
had better turn a wild Arab horse afield, and bid
me catch him. Don't I pray? Don't I plead to
him&mdash;ay, till my very soul dissolves in words, to
keep him at home from mad companions? What
can I do? A sister cannot tether him. <i>Love</i>
alone would save him.'</p>

<p>'Love? Ah, you speak to me o' what I know
nothing; my heart, you know, is'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'True as steel.'</p>

<p>'Ay, but as cold. But if a maiden's love
indeed would save him, ask some one whom
Master Fleming could love; ask Mistress Warriston;
and he may come to love her.'</p>

<p>'Well; indeed he might. And May is an
heiress too, and lovely. When Charlie cared not
for her, he was a boy; and now he is grown a
man, older than his years. Do you truly advise
me to ask May here, who had indeed, we both
thought long ago, some secret liking for my poor
Charlie?'</p>

<p>'I don't advise,' quoth Mistress Dinnage. 'But,
ask her.' Then again: 'Well, do as it pleases you.
I won't advise. I know not if it would be for
good or ill.'</p>

<p>'How could it be for ill?'</p>

<p>'It might break Mistress Warriston's heart,
which is so tender!'</p>

<p>'How know you it is so tender?'</p>

<p>'Because it is worn upon her sleeve, and ever
melts in tears.'</p>

<p>'I love her for that womanliness.'</p>

<p>The proud lip of Mistress Dinnage curled. 'Yes,
it is well. Tears ease the heart, and ladies have
time to weep.'</p>

<p>'<i>You</i> would never weep, whatever ailed ye. Oh,
thou'rt a proud incomprehensible little maid. I
would like to see thee well in love.'</p>

<p>'That ye never will.'</p>

<p>'Never boast. It is a sign of weakness, Mistress
mine. But is there a doubt that Charlie Fleming
would <i>not</i> love one so charming as May? Were
I a man, I would worship her; and it is such bold
spirits as his that love the soft and tender. Charlie
<i>will not</i> woo; he looks askance to <i>be</i> wooed, and
would love the maiden wooer! <i>I</i> know Charlie
Fleming.'</p>

<p>'Then if he loves to be wooed,' said Mistress
Dinnage, with a fierce scorn, 'let him seek it in
the streets of Granta; fair enough women there,
and ready too. I thought not that Master Fleming
would love such kind!'</p>

<p>Deborah withdrew her arm from her companion's,
and answered coldly: 'You offend me.
You wilfully misunderstand me. But how can I
look to be understood by one who knows no softness,
no weakness of her sex! You have a hard,
hard heart, Mistress Dinnage, if it be a noble one.
The good <i>you</i> do is never done for love.'</p>

<p>'True enow, good sooth. But such poor love
as ye describe, defend me from! It is water and
milk at best. If God made me love, my love
would lie so deep that the man who would win it
must dig and dig to find it. Ay, hard!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">{612}</a></span></p>

<p>'Proud Mistress mine, do you value yourself
thus highly?'</p>

<p>'Ay, I am a poor girl; but I have an honest
heart, Mistress Fleming, and value it as highly as
any lady in the land. He who loves, but thinks it
not worth the winning, let him go; he who sets
not such store by my love, let him go; and if the
right man never comes, let the others go! If
Margaret Dinnage could have loved, it would have
been thus with her; and the hidden unvalued
love would live and die within one heart.'</p>

<p>'I know it, I know it!' cried Deborah impulsively.
'O noble heart! <i>this</i> is the kind of love
I can feel for, for I have it beating here;' and
Deborah laid her hand upon her own breast. 'One
thing you lack, Meg&mdash;that would make you perfect.
<i>Love!</i>' Pleading, earnest, sweet, significant,
tender, emphatic, was the utterance of the last
imperative word, and Deborah's arms were round
her friend, and her upturned face upon Margaret's
breast. So in the moonlight the girls stood: a
fair picture, for the head of Mistress Dinnage was
turned aside, and her grave dark eyes averted;
and in that moment each proud heart was revealed
to each. '<i>Let</i> thyself love,' continued Deborah, in
her sweetest softest tones. 'Ye can be <i>too</i> proud,
Mistress Dinnage. The day will come when ye
will rue it bitterly. I would not urge ye, if I
divined not the secret of another heart. Are you
so blind that ye cannot see it too? The restlessness
when you're not by; the wistful eye&mdash;that <i>I</i>
dare not answer! O Mistress Dinnage, if Kingston
Fleming had had <i>one</i> such look for me, in
those old days, child as I was, I would have loved
him before all the world, truly and unchangeably.
Know ye not that I speak the truth? Would I
urge ye to your ruin? When once a Fleming
loves, he never loves but honourably. Then, his
fate is not in <i>my</i> hands&mdash;but in thine.' There was
silence. The last three words, though whispered,
rang again and again in the listener's ears like
music. What Mistress Dinnage thought then,
was not told, but Deborah felt the wild heaving
of her breast.</p>

<p>So a few moments passed, and Margaret put
Deborah from her with firm but gentle hands.
'Talk no more of this,' she said, while they walked
on. 'I will not be so stubborn as to seem ignorant
of your meaning. But I do not think with you.
No; do not speak, my sweet Mistress Deborah; no
words will make us think alike. What! was it not
so in the old days, that your heart would ever
outrun your head, and ye <i>would</i> believe what ye
longed for? Noble it is of ye to long for this; but
Deborah Fleming, ye are like no other woman
living, rich or poor. Ye are <i>yourself</i>; and I know
you to be above all the littlenesses of woman-kind.'</p>

<p>Deborah blushed with pleasure. 'Hush, hush!'
she said. 'This from you is too high praise; and
dangerous, because you mean it all, and no flattery.
But if it <i>is</i> noble to plead for one's dearest wish,
and to choose above all rank and riches one's best
and dearest friend, then I must be a very noble
maid! But it seems to me simple nature, and no
nobility. God has given me no ambition for great
things; on the other hand, He has given me the
power of loving faithfully; so that through all,
with all her faults, never think but that Deborah
Fleming will be true to her nature&mdash;true to those
dearer than her own life!'</p>

<p>And then, Mistress Dinnage beginning, they
talked of Kingston Fleming. A very frequent
subject of conversation was he. It would not be
fair to write all the nonsense that maidens will
talk, even a Mistress Fleming and a Mistress
Dinnage, for diamonds are found in dust. And
they talked with great earnestness and gravity of
the lace cap and discussed every minute point of
dress; and what should be done if King Fleming
came, and there was no host to receive him.
Would he stay? Would it be seemly? Surely,
with Dame Marjory&mdash;and much laughter even; for
laughter and tears are near akin; and in April,
sun follows showers.</p>


<h4>CHAPTER THE EIGHTH.</h4>

<p>The next morning, Deborah, in her great saloon,
was tending her flowers and thinking of Charlie,
when she heard her father's step. With a rush she
was out, and the sun streamed out with her
through the open door.</p>

<p>'My Rose of Enderby, art smartening up! The
lad Kingston will be here to-morrow.'</p>

<p>Deborah's treacherous heart gave a great leap.
'Who told you so?' she asked calmly.</p>

<p>'This scrawl. Why, Deb, ye must look gladder
than that; he is your cousin, ye know: or have ye
forgot him?'</p>

<p>Deborah read the note in silence, and then her
busy bewildered thoughts flew off. Oh, she must
be calm; this would never do; she must be
'Mistress Deborah Fleming,' receiving in all
cousinly courtesy the affianced lover of Mistress
Beatrix Blancheflower, her rival beauty in a rival
county.</p>

<p>'Father,' said Deborah, with sudden laughing
joy, 'I must have some guests to meet him.
Why, I have seldom had a party here; a very little
money will go a long long way to make this bright
and gay, and you have a store of good old wine
still left. Wine and flowers and <i>women</i>, father!
What more do mortals want? And it will be
returning Master Sinclair's generosity, which
necessity weighs heavily on us, till it be paid.
Oh, leave it to me, father, and you will think me
a rare Mistress of Enderby!'</p>

<p>Sir Vincent looked round somewhat ruefully.
'<i>Must</i> it be, sweet heart, and even to-morrow? It
cannot be.'</p>

<p>'It can. Trust in me. Why, father, you will be
the gayest of the gay, as ye always are at such
times. Dost give consent?'</p>

<p>'Why yes, tyrant. But ask Adam Sinclair.'</p>

<p>'Trust me.' And Deborah was out and away to
Dame Marjory and Mistress Dinnage. The lord of
Lincoln for once would be welcomed!</p>

<p>It pleased Deborah to have a banquet in the
hall and music in the saloon. Why, she had
twenty pounds a year; and good lack! One could
not <i>always</i> contemplate ruin. A Fleming was
coming home; they would 'kill the fatted calf.'
Such pleasures were far between.</p>

<p>It was short notice, but willing messengers were
soon afoot, and Granta was laid under requisition
for guests. Deborah, happy and proud, sent the
word to all invited guests that short notice was
involuntary on her part; her cousin Kingston
Fleming was coming home suddenly, and who
could, must come and dance at Enderby. So
what with Granta men and young belles of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">{613}</a></span>
Deborah's age, and a few old dowagers and a
few Adam Sinclairs, the party was made up.
Deborah was lucky. She, in her sheeny lovely
dress, was well-nigh worshipped by the men,
she looked so full of life, so brilliant. But no
Charlie! That was the one drawback; nor did
Adam Sinclair know where he was, save that he
had left Lincoln the day before in good spirits.
Deborah knew in her heart what that meant. As
she conversed, she looked full at Adam Sinclair,
and felt to love all man and woman kind. The
aged wooer trembled before the gracious girl; time
only heightened his passion and hardened his
determination to win Deborah Fleming at all
hazards. The county had already begun to whisper
about his infatuation and her coldness.</p>

<p>Eyes enough were upon them though, and the
dowagers decided that so far from being 'cold,'
Deborah Fleming encouraged him by every means
in her power.</p>

<p>'Mistress Fleming,' he whispered ardently,
'give me some token to-night&mdash;some slight token
of favour. Your eyes look kind to-night. Give
me that rose.'</p>

<p>Deborah glanced at the red rose in her breast.
'This rose, Master Sinclair? Nay; not this: there
are a thousand others in the garden. Marjory
shall bring ye one.'</p>

<p>'I covet this one, Mistress Fleming, warm from
your heart. What is it to you? And <i>I</i> would
give a hundred crowns to possess it.'</p>

<p>'It would seem perchance a love-token, and
those I never give.'</p>

<p>'Ye are obdurate.'</p>

<p>Deborah turned away from those gleaming eyes.
'I am honest,' she said.</p>

<p>'Mistress Leyton,' said Adam Sinclair, turning
with a courtly smile to an old dame who was
sitting near, drinking elder-berry wine and listening
open-eared, 'will ye not plead my cause? Here
is Mistress Fleming will give me nought. And
what do I ask? Nothing, but that red rose from
her gown.'</p>

<p>'What would you do in my place, Mistress
Leyton?' asked Deborah.</p>

<p>'Why, if I favoured Master Sinclair, I would
give him the rose.'</p>

<p>'You put it very strongly,' laughed Deborah.
'But you have released me from my strait, for I
could neither be so bold as to <i>favour</i> Master
Sinclair nor so rude as to shew him none; so I
give my rose to you.'</p>

<p>'Keep it, child; it looks so lovely. It suits too
thy name&mdash;Rose of Enderby.'</p>

<p>'Mistress Leyton, you must bring this Rose to
Lincoln one day,' said Adam Sinclair. 'Now do
this much for me, for old acquaintance' sake!'</p>

<p>'But will Mistress Deborah come?'</p>

<p>'I know not,' answered Deborah, smiling. 'What
I would like now, I may not like to-morrow.'</p>

<p>'Thou art a spoiled child and a wilful one.'</p>

<p>'Yes; I fear me it is so. But Master Sinclair,
I am not ungracious.'</p>

<p>'I think ye are. Come one moment to this
window.' He led Deborah into the recess, and
asked her to gather him a rose, a red rose. The
brilliant lights flashed athwart them; near by
stood a bevy of young and scowling men; the
roses were laughing and fluttering about the casement.
The tall old figure was bending down, and
Deborah, gay yet reluctant, and looking gloriously
beautiful, raised her eyes to present the gift, when
Kingston Fleming entered.</p>

<p>He had heard enough on the way about 'Mistress
Deborah Fleming' and 'Master Sinclair;' all
rumours united their names, till he knew not what
to believe, but laughed and wondered. So, with
his old indolent curiosity, he looked up at Enderby,
and saw lights gleam through the great windows,
heard music, and saw dancing forms flit by. He
raised his glass, and laughed. 'Why, Deb is
queening it right royally! I imagine Master
Sinclair is among the guests.' And wondering at
it all, and greatly edified, Master Kingston Fleming,
having first put his travelling-dress in some slight
order, was conducted by Dame Marjory along the
gallery. 'Are they often so gay, Marjory?' he
asked, laughing at her grim but important countenance.</p>

<p>'<i>Never, never</i>, Master King! Bless thee, no.
There are lonesome hours enow at Enderby, an'
Master Charlie never here. This is a whim of the
young mistress to welcome <i>thee</i>, Master King;'
and her features relaxed into a grim smile. 'She
has such a whim now and again.'</p>

<p>So Kingston Fleming entered, and saw the
picture we have drawn. From that moment the
mad young hoyden faded for ever from Kingston's
mind, into the stately beauty who stood there.
She turned, the colour flushed to her cheeks and
light sprang to her eyes. 'Kingston!'</p>

<p>'Why, Deb! But "<i>little</i> Deb" no longer.
How changed! I scarce know you.'</p>

<p>Then Sir Vincent came forward, and they were
parted, for Mistress Fleming had duties to fulfil.
But ever Kingston's eyes followed her, though she
had no eyes for him. Then there was the dancing,
and all were seeking Deborah; she was surrounded;
and often she saw herself in the tall old
mirrors, and her beauty flashed on her like a
surprise. Deborah Fleming carried all before her
that night; she sang&mdash;that was her one perfect gift;
she had a splendid voice, and sang with power
and sweetness, and some deep emotion threw
passion into her song that night. Then there was
the supper, when Adam Sinclair sat on Deborah's
right hand. Then another measure. But Kingston
would not dance, though he loved it with
enthusiasm. Then there was the hour of two
tolled out from the chimes of Enderby, and the
last carriage rolled away.</p>

<p>'Come down and smoke a pipe, boy,' said Sir
Vincent; and Kingston said he would follow.</p>

<p>Deborah, tired, but strangely happy, had thrown
herself on a sofa. 'Not yet, King,' said she. 'You
have been away for two long years; you have
much to tell me, sure. You have seen May
Warriston?'</p>

<p>'Ay; in a picture-gallery at Florence.'</p>

<p>'Was she changed?'</p>

<p>'She was prettier and graver. I even thought
little May somewhat staid and prim; but then old
Guardy was at her elbow.'</p>

<p>'Did she speak of me&mdash;of us?'</p>

<p>'Of you, a hundred times.'</p>

<p>'Sweet May! And you, Kingston'&mdash;Deborah
blushed and hesitated&mdash;'you have come from
Rimbolton?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>(Why would he not speak, and aid her?) Deborah
continued shyly: 'And is&mdash;Mistress Blancheflower
well?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">{614}</a></span></p>

<p>'I thank ye, very well.'</p>

<p>Deborah could say no more anent that. 'Are
you changed, King, in looks? Let me see.' She
bent forward, and laid one hand upon his. 'Nay;
the old comic King, with whom I ofttimes
quarrelled sore; only browner, thinner, graver too,
as I see thee now.'</p>

<p>'Cares o' the world, Deb. Where is boy Charlie?'</p>

<p>'Nay; I know not.' What a sudden paleness
and abstraction overspread the sweet face! 'Charlie
is much away, Kingston. I hope you will see him
and talk to my dear boy like a good kinsman.
Charlie needs a sterling friend.'</p>

<p>Kingston looked grave, thinking perhaps how
far he himself had led Charlie from the straight
and narrow track. He answered gaily, however:
'Oh, he is young yet. Charlie promised to be a
fine fellow in the end; and with his talents, we
must make something of him. Don't despair, Deb.'</p>

<p>'Nay; I never despair.'</p>

<p>'I hear that he is a friend of Master Adam
Sinclair's.'</p>

<p>'Yes. Didst hear that at Rimbolton?'</p>

<p>'Yes; and elsewhere too.'</p>

<p>'Then ye have doubtless heard most tidings?'</p>

<p>'Yes, Deb. Tidings spread like wild-fire on a
country-side; but I don't credit all I hear, or I
should believe ye to be betrothed to Adam
Sinclair.'</p>

<p>'When <i>I</i> tell you, you may believe that, not
till then,' answered the maiden.</p>

<p>Then followed a long silence, and Kingston
looked on vacancy through the fading rose on
Deborah's breast. O irrevocable past! O vague
dark future! 'You used to hate me, Deb,' said he
suddenly, at last.</p>

<p>'Ay? Did I? Well, perhaps I hate you now.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps you are grown a little hypocrite, as
you give me kind smiles in place o' former frowns.'</p>

<p>'That is a necessary duty. I smile at Master
Sinclair.'</p>

<p>'There is no disguise <i>there</i>. It springs from the
heart, Deb.'</p>

<p>'You can read my heart then? No; I do not
hate you, Kingston; I love you as my kinsman
and my brother's truest friend.'</p>

<p>'Not always his true friend, Deb,' said Kingston
quickly. 'Don't give me more than my due.'</p>

<p>'Well, I don't hate you for your candour, but
rather love you, King.'</p>

<p>'Dost love me, Deb?' Kingston Fleming looked
up strangely and suddenly from under his long
love-lock with his old arch smile, but there was a
wistful sadness in it too.</p>

<p>Deborah blushed scarlet at the sudden question.
'Love ye?' she begged curtly, to hide her confusion.
'Ay, well enough. We <i>shall</i> be friends, I know.
We will quarrel no more, King; we two <i>must</i> be
friends.'</p>

<p>'Friends, sweet heart&mdash;<i>friends</i>?' What ailed him
as he murmured these words? He seemed like
one distraught. Springing up, he paced to and
fro the long length of the saloon, then stopped
before the maiden.</p>

<p>'Well, good-bye, Deb. I am tongue-tied in thy
presence. I had better go. Kiss me!'</p>

<p>Deborah blushed. 'Nay; I never did that.'</p>

<p>'Is that a reason ye <i>never</i> should?' And Kingston
stooped and kissed her.</p>

<p>He was gone. Was it pleasure or pain that
caused Deborah's heart to beat so wildly?</p>

<p>'Oh, this must not be,' she exclaimed passionately.
'This shall not be. I love him madly.
And he? Oh, shame on me, to let him do this
thing, and trifle with me thus! He, affianced
meantime to Mistress Blancheflower; and thinks
the while to play with Deborah Fleming's heart!'
The girl started up, and paced where Kingston
had paced before her. '<i>Two</i> can play at this,' she
said. 'Ah, Master King Fleming, if ye think to
lower a Fleming's pride, it shall go hardly with
ye! But if ye mean well, I will bless thy future,
and still love thee&mdash;as neither friend nor
foe.' Deborah's voice sank to a whisper of unutterable
tenderness. "Friends, sweet heart&mdash;<i>friends</i>?"
What meant he by that, but to put
vain and wicked love-thoughts in my head?
Can I believe thee so dishonoured, Kingston?
Thou, whom I thought the soul of honour! It
cannot be. But I will watch thee well. Love
thee as a <i>friend</i>, forsooth! It is Deborah Fleming's
curse to have a heart true to one life-long
love, one long unmaidenly love&mdash;because unsought,
uncared for. Ah me! I fear myself. I dare not
think on Mistress Blancheflower, lest I seek to do
her some grievous harm. I dare not think on that
marriage-day. O Beatrix Blancheflower, do ye
love him well? So well, that ye are worthy of my
sacrifice? Ah! why did King Fleming come here!
For the love of honour and of good faith to
Mistress Blancheflower, I will estrange him from
me.'</p>

<h2><a name="ITALIAN_VAGRANT_CHILDREN" id="ITALIAN_VAGRANT_CHILDREN">ITALIAN VAGRANT CHILDREN.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Little</span> Giovanni Alessandro Bosco, the bright-eyed
Italian boy who has a couple of white mice
to attract the attention of passers-by, or believes
that kind folks will perchance give a copper for
hearing a tune played on a small barrel-organ, is
not perhaps aware that he has risen to the dignity
of being officially noticed. In other words, Italian
organ-boys, image-boys, street exhibitors, and appellants
to a compassionate public, have been the
subject of correspondence between the diplomatists
of Italy and those of England. The despatches or
communications have lately been published in a
blue-book or parliamentary paper; shewing that
European governments are now alive to sympathies
which would have had but little chance of manifesting
their presence in an earlier and ruder state
of society.</p>

<p>About three years and a half ago, we gave an
account of what had come under our knowledge
in Italy concerning the deportation of Italian
boys as beggars or exhibitors. We stated that
'Much to its credit, the parliament of Italy have
before them a bill to abolish the system of
apprenticing children of less than eighteen years
of age to strolling trades or professions, such as
mountebanks, jugglers, charlatans, rope-dancers,
fortune-tellers, expounders of dreams, itinerant
musicians, vocalists or instrumentalists, exhibitors
of animals, and mendicants of every description,
at home or abroad, under a penalty of two pounds
to ten pounds for each offence, and from one to
three months' imprisonment. It is to be trusted
that this will shortly become law, and so put an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">{615}</a></span>
end to one of the most crying evils of our time.'
Subsequent facts shew that, although this law has
passed in Italy, and may in that country be producing
some good results, it has not in any way
lessened the number of vagrant Italian children
seen in the streets of London and other English
towns. How it happens that the remedial
measure has not relieved our shores from this
incubus, we will explain presently; but it may
be well first to summarise a few of the statements
in the former article, sufficient to shew the mode
in which this cruel traffic is carried on.</p>

<p>In years gone by, when Italy was split up into
a number of kingdoms, dukedoms, and petty states,
very little attention was paid to the general welfare
of the people; the peasants and small cultivators
were often so hardly driven that the support
of a family became a serious responsibility; and a
people, naturally kind rather than the reverse, were
tempted to the adoption of a course from which
their better feeling would have revolted. They
did not actually <i>sell</i> their children, but they apprenticed
them off for a time, on the receipt of a
sum of money. The <i>padroni</i> or masters, to whom
the children were apprenticed, were men whose
only sympathy was for themselves and their own
pockets; they made specious promises, and got
the poor young creatures, eight years old or so,
into their hands. Too often, the parents never
saw the children again, and remained quite ignorant
of their fate. It was not in Italy that the
scoundrels kept their victims; they mostly crossed
the Alps into France, whence many of them found
their way to England. Or else they were shipped
at Genoa, and conveyed at cheap rates to such
shores as seemed likely to be most profitable to
the <i>padroni</i>. As these men acquire an accurate
knowledge of the extent to which sheer open
beggary is illegal in this or that country, they
adopt a blind, by turning the poor children into
exhibitors of white mice, marmots, or monkeys.
Advanced a little in age and experience, the boys
are intrusted with small organs, and perhaps later
with organs of larger size. Those whose strength
of constitution enables them to bear a life of hardship
during the so-called apprenticeship can sometimes
obtain an organ on hire from one of the
makers of those instruments, and become itinerant
organ-grinders on their own account. But there is
reason to fear that the poor boys too often succumb
to the treatment they receive, and die at an early
age. As to what befalls the girls thus expatriated,
another sad picture would have to be drawn.</p>

<p>No resident in London, no visitor to London,
need be told of the organ nuisance. Some of the
organs, it is true, are really of excellent tone, and
play good music; but they become a pest in this
way&mdash;that the men, taking note of the houses
whence they have obtained money, stop in front
of those houses more and more frequently, in the
hope of being paid, if not for playing, at least for
going away. Some of these organ-men have been
organ-boys who came over with <i>padroni</i>.</p>

<p>And now for the diplomatic correspondence
relating to this subject.</p>

<p>In 1874 the Chevalier Cadorna, Italian Minister
at the Court of St James's, addressed a communication
to the Earl of Derby relating to these
wretched and ill-used children. He stated that a
law had been passed in Italy, the success of which
would depend largely on the co-operation of other
governments. It had been ascertained that in
many provinces of that country parents lease or
lend their children for money; boys and girls
under eight years of age, who are taken by vile
speculators to foreign lands, there to be employed
as musicians, tumblers, dancers, exhibitors of white
mice, beggars, &amp;c. It is a white slave-trade, in
which the unfeeling parents participate. London
is especially noted for the presence of these
unfortunates; the <i>padroni</i> or masters find that a
good harvest may be made out of the injudicious
because indiscriminate charity of the metropolis.
'Miserable it is for the children,' says M. Cadorna,
'if they fail any day to obtain the sum which
their tyrants require from them! This is the
reason why we often see them wandering about
till late at night, exhausted by fatigue and hunger,
rather than return to the lodgings where they
dread ill-treatment of various kinds from their
pitiless masters.' The police magistrates of London
are frequently occupied in listening to the complaints
of these poor creatures. But no: this is
hardly the case; for the victims are generally
afraid to make their sorrows known, lest they
should suffer still worse from the vengeance of
their taskmasters; sometimes, however, they are
too ill from bad treatment to conceal their misery;
while at other times they are taken up for begging.
Who knows? perhaps the poor things receive
better food and lodging during a few days' imprisonment&mdash;certainly
better in a reformatory or
a workhouse&mdash;than in the squalid rooms which
their tyrants provide for them.</p>

<p>The Italian government are endeavouring to
check the evil at its source or fountain-head;
making the leasing of children by their parents
illegal. If this does not produce a cure, then they
are endeavouring to watch the slave-traders (as we
may truly call them), and forbid them to carry
their victims across the frontier or out to sea.
When the Chevalier Cadorna made his communication
to the Earl of Derby, the new law had
been too recently passed to supply evidence of its
practical effect; but he pointed to the fact that the
law could not meet with full success unless foreign
governments would render aid, by making this
kind of Italian slavery unlawful in the countries to
which the <i>padroni</i> bring their little victims. A
suggestion was made that the Extradition convention,
signed between England and Italy, might
possibly be made to take cognizance of this state of
things. Not so, it appears. The Home Secretary,
when appealed to, stated that traffic in children is
not within any of the crimes named in the English
Extradition Acts. 'It appears to Mr Cross that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">{616}</a></span>
the source of the evil arises in Italy, and that
measures might be there adopted for preventing
the egress from that country of such children as
are described in the letter of the Italian Minister.
He supposes that it would be competent to the
Italian government to decline to grant passports for
such children, and thus prevent their crossing the
Italian frontier. There is no power to prevent
such children from landing in this country. All
that can be done is to protect them from any
cruelty or ill-treatment on the part of <i>padroni</i>;
and Mr Cross is assured that the metropolitan
magistrates are most anxious to carry out that
object, and that they are very desirous to abate
the evils as far as our laws empower them to do so.'</p>

<p>So the matter rested for a time. Three years
later, in May of the present year, the subject was
mentioned in the House of Commons; and the
Italian Minister, General Menabrea (successor to
the Chevalier Cadorna), informed the Earl of Derby
that the Italian government cannot effect all they
wish in preventing the exodus of the <i>padroni</i> and
their victims. 'It is easy for them to elude the
vigilance of the authorities; for passports being
now practically abolished from Italy to France,
and thence to England, the traffickers in children
can, by expatriating themselves, relieve themselves
from the punishments they have incurred.'</p>

<p>Thus the inquiry ended nearly as it began, so far
as definite conclusions are concerned. England is
very chary of making restrictions on the freedom
of entry of foreigners on our shores. Deposed
emperors and kings, princes in trouble, defeated
presidents and past presidents, persecuted ecclesiastics,
patriots out of work&mdash;all find an asylum in
little England; and many things would have to be
taken into account before our government could
legally forbid the Italian children and their
<i>padroni</i> from setting foot on English ground.</p>

<p>No one can glance habitually through the daily
newspapers without meeting with cases illustrating
the condition of the poor Italian children. Some
months back the magistrates of North Shields had
a boy and a girl brought before them charged with
begging. The fact came out in evidence that
their <i>padrone</i> had bought or farmed them of their
parents, and brought them to England. Marianna
Frametta was fourteen years of age, Marcolatto
Crola eleven. He had bought or rather leased
them for twelve months, at ten pounds each: his
calculation being that this sum, four shillings a
week, would be amply covered, and much more,
after providing them with board and lodging, by
their earnings. They usually, it appears, got from
nine to fifteen shillings a <i>day</i> by begging, possibly
with the addition of some small pretence to an
exhibition of white mice. If they brought home
less than ten shillings each, they were beaten instead
of fed at night. These sums appear strangely
large; but so stands the record. It is satisfactory
to know that the fellow was punished with
imprisonment and hard labour for his cruelty.
But what would eventually be the life of the
children themselves? They were sent to the
workhouse for temporary shelter, food, and medical
treatment; these could only last for a time; and
the youngsters would still be aliens, without
definite occupation or means of livelihood.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the English habit
of giving small sums of money to people in the
streets and at the street doors has something to do
with this matter. It may be due to a kind motive,
but it unquestionably increases the number of
applicants, and opposes a bar to the endeavours
of governments and legislatures to bring about an
improvement. Nevertheless it is quite right that
all should be done that can be done to prevent
ruthless speculators from bringing over poor Italian
children to our shores, and then treating them
like veritable slaves. This should all the more
sedulously be attended to, because the <i>padroni</i>
(so far as concerns the metropolis) live almost
exclusively in one district, around Hatton Garden
and Leather Lane. The narrow streets, courts,
and alleys in that vicinity are crowded with them;
every room in some of the houses being occupied
by a distinct Italian batch, crowded together like
pigs in a sty, and forming hotbeds of disease.
When the 'Health Act' and the 'Lodging-Houses
Act' gave the police power to enter such wretched
apologies for dwellings, fearful scenes of this kind
were brought to light. Matters are gradually being
improved, but only by dint of constant vigilance.</p>

<p>Evidently there is an anxiety on the part of the
Home Secretary to do all in his power to suppress
the scandal, as is evidenced by the following circular,
addressed to the police authorities of the
metropolis: 'The attention of the Secretary of
State has been called to the practice under which
children bought or stolen from parents in Italy or
elsewhere are imported into this country by persons
known by the name of <i>padroni</i>, who send
them into the streets to earn money by playing
musical instruments, selling images, begging, or
otherwise. It is most important to suppress this
traffic by every available means, and Mr Cross
relies on the vigilant co-operation of the police for
this purpose. In many cases the employer will be
found to have committed an offence against the
Vagrant Act, 5 George IV. cap. 88, by procuring
the child to beg. If so, he should be forthwith
prosecuted, and the result of such prosecution
should be made the subject of a special report to
the Secretary of State. The child will probably
come within the provisions of the 14th section of
the Industrial Schools Act, 1866 (29 and 30 Vic.
cap. 118), either under the first clause (as a child
begging alms), or under the second clause (as a
child wandering and without proper guardianship).
An application should therefore be made to the
justices for the child to be sent to a certified
industrial school. Further application should be
made, under section 19, for the temporary detention
of the child in the workhouse until the
industrial school has been selected, information
being at once communicated to the Secretary of
State, in order that, if requisite, he may render
assistance in making the necessary arrangements.
The final result of each case should also be
reported to the Home Secretary.'</p>

<p>In conclusion, we are glad to see from the
newspapers that the Brighton School Board, by
enforcing the provisions of the Elementary Education
Act, have been successful in terrifying the
<i>padroni</i> who bring Italian vagrant children to
the town, and thereby have banished them with
their unhappy victims. The circumstance offers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">{617}</a></span>
a good hint to local authorities. Rigidly apply

<p>'<span class="smcap">What's</span> this?' cried Miss Hammond, breaking
open a letter just handed to her by a servant.
'You read it, Maggie; your eyes are better than
mine.'</p>

<p>Small wonder at that indeed, seeing that Maggie
is aged about eighteen, and the other sixty-five at
the very least, a pleasant-looking, well-preserved
spinster, with a brown resolute face and sausage
curls over the forehead. Maggie, a handsome
modern girl, sits down and reads:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Madam</span>&mdash;The parishioners of St Crispin, Gigglesham,
in vestry assembled, have determined to
rebuild their parish church, pronounced unsafe
by the surveyors. Contributions are earnestly
requested. The alterations will necessitate the
removal of many vaults and graves; among others,
that of the Hammond family. It is the wish of the
churchwardens to respect the wishes of survivors
and others in the disposal of the remains. Any

<p>The two Misses Hammond (Margaret and Ellen)
are joint proprietors of the comfortable estate of
Westbury, near Gigglesham, and of the handsome
mansion thereto belonging. Maggie, the young
girl, is a distant cousin&mdash;although she calls them
'aunt'&mdash;and lives with them. There is also a
young man, Ralph Grant, somewhere about the
place, of whom more anon.</p>

<p>Old Tom Hammond, the father of the two
maiden sisters, was born in the year 1740, and
might have seen the heads over Temple Bar after
the rising of 1745. He lived till 1830. He had
married late in life, and left only these two
daughters. Thus two generations bridged over a
space of time generally occupied by many successive
lives; as in the case of another branch of the
family, the founder of which, Major Richard
Hammond (the uncle of the two old ladies), who
had been at the capture of Quebec when General
Wolfe was killed, being the great-grandfather of
Maggie Lauderdale and Ralph Grant. Major
Hammond was the elder of the two brothers, and
should have inherited the Westbury estate; but
he offended his father, General John Hammond,
by what was called a low marriage, and was disinherited
in consequence.</p>

<p>Tom Hammond had done his best to remedy
his father's injustice, as far as he could without
injuring himself and his own, by making a settlement
of the estate, in failure of his own issue, upon
the lawful descendants of Major Hammond, his
brother; providing that if the issue of his elder
brother should fail, the estate should go to the
issue of a younger brother Henry, who, by the way,
had been well provided for by the small estate of
Eastbury. This brother Henry was now represented
through the female line by a Mr Boodles of
Boodle Court, who now also held the Eastbury estate.</p>

<p>The descendants of Major Hammond are now
confined to these two young people, Maggie and
Ralph. They are both orphans and without
means, their forebears having been mostly in the
soldiering and official lines. Ralph is a lieutenant
in the artillery, and his battery is now in India;
but he is at home on sick-leave; and he has taken
advantage of his furlough to win the affections of
his fair cousin. As the Westbury estate would
come to be eventually divided between them, it
was considered a most fortunate thing that the
young people had come to an understanding.
Ralph was to leave the service when he married,
and take the home-farm. By-and-by he would
fall naturally into his position as country squire;
and it was arranged that eventually he should
assume the name of Hammond; hoping to continue
the old line.</p>

<p>This preamble being necessary, let us now return
to the comfortable old-fashioned drawing-room at
Westbury.</p>

<p>'What do you think of that, Ellen?' cried Miss
Hammond, having read over once more the circular
to herself with subdued emphasis. Miss Ellen was
sitting looking into the fire, her great wooden
knitting-pins and bright-coloured wools lying idle
on her lap, as she shook her head while talking
gently to herself.</p>

<p>'Do you hear, Ellen?' cried Miss Hammond
more sharply. 'What do you think of that letter
from Truscott?'</p>

<p>'I don't like the idea at all, Margaret. No, not
at all. Why can't they leave our ancestors alone?
And I am sure I always looked forward to being
buried there myself.'</p>

<p>'La! don't talk about that, Ellen, and you five
years the younger!' said Miss Hammond briskly;
'and as we can't prevent its being done, we must
make the best of it. Ralph had better go and see
to it.'</p>

<p>'Very well, sister; as you like,' said Ellen. Presently
she resumed: 'Sister, I've been thinking
that this would be a good chance to try to get back
Uncle Richard Hammond's ring.'</p>

<p>'Uncle Hammond's ring!' repeated the elder
sister. 'I don't understand.'</p>

<p>'You must have heard our father talk about it.
The family ring that ought to have gone with the
estates&mdash;a ruby and sapphire that General Hammond
brought home from Ceylon.'</p>

<p>'I ought to know all about it Ellen, I daresay;
but you were so much more with my poor father,
and had more patience with his stories.'</p>

<p>'My father often tried to get the ring, and had
offered to give Major Hammond a large sum for it.
But he was so vexed with father for supplanting
him, that he vowed he never should have it; and
they say, sister, that rather than it should ever fall
into his brother's hands, he had it buried with him,
upon his finger. Our father always said that if he
had a chance he would have the coffin opened to
see.'</p>

<p>Maggie, who had retreated to a sofa, and buried
her head in a novel, roused up at this, and joined
in: 'I hope you will, auntie. I do hope you'll
have it looked for.'</p>

<p>'I don't know, my dear,' said Miss Hammond.
'I don't approve of violating the sanctity of the
tomb.'</p>

<p>With the elder Miss Hammond, a phrase was
everything; she delighted to bring a thing within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">{618}</a></span>
the compass of a well-rounded phrase, upon which
she would then make a stand&mdash;invincible. So
Maggie threw up her head in a kind of despair, and
ran off to look for Ralph, who when last heard of
was smoking a cigar on the terrace.</p>

<p>'Ralph!' said Maggie as soon as she had found
him, and had submitted to a very smoky kiss&mdash;they
were in the heyday of their young loves, when
kisses were appreciated, even when flavoured with
tobacco&mdash;'Ralph! auntie is going to give you a
commission&mdash;to go and see about a vault at St
Crispin's where some of our ancestors lie.'</p>

<p>'I know,' said Ralph; 'they are going to pull
the old place down. All right; I'll do it.'</p>

<p>Then Maggie went on to tell him about the ring,
and how Miss Hammond would not have it
searched for. 'But it is a very valuable ring&mdash;a
family one too. It would be a great pity to miss
it, if it's really there.'</p>

<p>Ralph agreed.</p>

<p>'Well, then, mind you look for it, sir; only
don't say a word to auntie, or she'll put a stop
to it.'</p>

<p>'I'm fly,' said Ralph, with a knowing wink, and
attempted a renewal of the oscillatory process; but
Maggie escaped him this time, and came fleeing
in at the dining-room window panting into the
presence of her aunts.</p>

<p>Since she first left the room, a visitor had
appeared&mdash;a Mr Boodles, a distant relative, who
had inherited some of the family property, as before
explained; a tall grim-looking man, with thin
iron-gray hair, carefully brushed off his temples.</p>

<p>The aunts were looking rather serious, not to
say frightened, and both started guiltily when
they saw Maggie.</p>

<p>'Leave us, my dear, please,' said Miss Hammond
gently.</p>

<p>Maggie had just caught the words, 'No
marriage at all,' from Mr Boodles, who seemed to
be speaking loudly and excitedly; and she went
out wandering what it all meant. Some piece of
scandal, no doubt, for Boodles was the quintessence
of spitefulness.</p>

<p>'It is very dreadful&mdash;very,' said Miss Hammond.
'I never had much opinion of Uncle Richard, you
know; but for the sake of the young people, I
hope you'll let it be kept a profound secret.'</p>

<p>'Sake of the young people!' screamed Boodles
at the top of his harsh voice. 'And what for the
sake of old Boodles? I'm the next heir, you'll
remember, please, through my maternal grandfather,
Henry Hammond.'</p>

<p>Mr Boodles had come to Westbury to announce
an important discovery that he had recently made.
In turning over some of his grandfather's papers he
had come across some letters from General Hammond,
in which it was firmly asserted that his son
Major Hammond had never been legally married
to the woman known as his wife.</p>

<p>'What end do you propose to serve, Mr Boodles,
by bringing this ancient scandal to light?' asked
Miss Hammond with agitated voice.</p>

<p>'End!' cried Boodles. 'This is only the beginning
of it. I am going to a court of law to have
myself declared heir to the Westbury estates under
the settlement.'</p>

<p>'In that case,' said Miss Hammond, rising with
dignity, 'you cannot be received on friendly terms
in my house.'</p>

<p>'Oh, very well, very well,' cried Boodles, snatching
up his hat and whip, and sweeping out of
the room without further ceremony.</p>

<p>As soon as the door had shut upon him the
sisters looked at each other in blank consternation.</p>

<p>'I always feared there would be a difficulty,'
said Ellen tremulously; 'but oh, to think of Boodles
having discovered it!'</p>

<p>'We must send for Smith at once; the carriage
shall go in and fetch him,' said Miss Hammond,
ringing the bell.</p>

<p>Mr Smith of Gigglesham was the family solicitor,
and the carriage was sent off to bring him up at
once for a consultation. But Smith brought little
encouragement. He had heard from his father
that there were curious circumstances attending
Major Hammond's marriage, and if Boodles had
put his finger on the flaw&mdash;&mdash; Smith shrugged
his shoulders for want of words to express the
awkwardness of the case.</p>

<p>'But search must be made everywhere; the
evidence of the marriage must be found; the
children must not suffer, poor things, and always
brought up to look upon the property as their
own!'</p>

<p>'Why, they could never marry,' cried Miss
Ellen; 'they could never live on Ralph's pay.'</p>

<p>'It's altogether dreadful; and not getting married
is the very lightest part of the calamity,' said Miss
Hammond.</p>

<p>Smith undertook that every possible search
should be made, and went away, promising to set
to work at once. But his inquiries had no result.
He had traced out the family of the reputed wife,
who had been the daughter of a small farmer
living at Milton in Kent; but they had now fallen
to the rank of labourers, and had no papers belonging
to them, hardly any family traditions. He
had searched all the registries of the neighbouring
parishes: no record of such a marriage could be
discovered. He had issued advertisements offering
a reward for the production of evidence: all of no
avail. What more could he do? To be sure there
was a presumption in favour of the marriage; but
then if Boodles had documents rebutting such a
presumption&mdash;&mdash; Again Mr Smith shrugged his
shoulders, in hopelessness of finding fitting words
to represent the gravity of the crisis. 'And then,'
he went on to say, 'the very fact that Boodles is
spending money over the case shews that he thinks
he has a strong one.'</p>

<p>Boodles did not let the grass grow under his
feet; he instituted proceedings at once, and cited
all interested to appear. The thing could no
longer be kept a secret; and Maggie and Ralph
were told of the cloud that had come over their
fortunes.</p>

<p>'I don't care if the property does go away,' said
Maggie bravely. 'It will make no difference. I
shall go to India with Ralph, that's all. I will be
a soldier's wife, and go on the baggage-wagons.'</p>

<p>Ralph shook his head. He had never been able
to manage on his pay when there was only himself,
and there were ever so many lieutenants on the
list before him, so that he could not hope to be
a captain for many years.</p>

<p>There was no use in sitting brooding over
coming misfortunes; and Ralph took the dogcart
and drove over to Gigglesham, to see about the
family vault at St Crispin's. It was an occupation
that agreed well with his temper; the weather too
seemed all in keeping&mdash;a dull drizzling day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">{619}</a></span></p>

<p>'Don't forget the ring,' Maggie had said to him
at parting; 'that is ours, you know Ralph, if we
find it; and perhaps it may be worth a lot of
money.'</p>

<p>Ralph shook his head incredulously. And yet
it was possible. The ring might be there, and it
might prove of great value. In misfortunes, the
mind grasps at the smallest alleviations, and Ralph
consoled himself in his depression by picturing the
finding of a splendid ruby worth say ten thousand
pounds. No more artillery-work then&mdash;no more
India.</p>

<p>Gigglesham boasts of several churches, and St
Crispin's lies in a hollow by the river, close to the
bridge. A low squat tower and plain ugly nave.
But in its nook there&mdash;the dark river flowing by,
the sail of a barge shewing now and then, the tall
piles of deals in the timber-yard beyond, the castle-keep
frowning from the heights, and the big water-mill
with its weirs and rapids, the noise of which
and of the great churning wheel sounded slumbrously
all day long&mdash;allied with these things, the
old church had something homely and pleasant
about it, hardly to be replaced by the finest modern
Gothic.</p>

<p>Workmen were swarming about it now. The
roof was nearly off. There were great piles of
sand and mortar in the graveyard. Mr Martin, the
plumber and glazier, who took the most lively
interest in the underground work, even to the
neglect of more profitable business, was on the look-out
for Lieutenant Grant, and greeted him cheerily.</p>

<p>'We've got 'em all laid out in the vestry, Cap'n
Grant, all the whole family; and now the question
is, what are you going to have done with them?
Would you like 'em put in the vaults below, where
they'll all be done up in lime and plaster? or
would you like 'em moved somewhere else&mdash;more
in the open air, like?'</p>

<p>'The least expensive way, I should say,' replied
Ralph grimly. Somehow or other his appreciation
of his ancestors was deadened by this last stroke
of fate in cutting him adrift from his succession.
'But look here, Martin,' he went on, taking the
plumber aside; 'there is one of the coffins, Major
Hammond's, I should like to have opened. It can
be done?'</p>

<p>'Easy enough, sir,' cried Martin, who, to say the
truth, was delighted at the prospect of a little
charnel-house work. 'He's a lead 'un, he is. I'll
have the top off in no time.'</p>

<p>Ralph looked gravely down at the last remains
of the Hammonds. The wife, if she had been a
wife, on whom their inheritance hung, was not
here; she had died in India. But there was the
Major's coffin, the wood-work decayed, but the
leaden envelope as sound as ever.</p>

<p>Martin was quickly at work with his tools. The
cover was stripped off, and for a moment the
Major's features were to be seen much as they had
been in life; then all dissolved into dust.</p>

<p>There was no ruby ring&mdash;that must have been a
fable; but there was something glittering among
the remains, and on taking it out, it proved to be
a plain gold hoop.</p>

<p>'Well, that's worth a pound, that is,' cried the
practical Martin, carefully polishing up the treasure-trove.
It had probably been hung round the
neck of the departed&mdash;a tall bony man&mdash;for the
ring was a small one, and there were traces of a
black ribbon attached to it.</p>

<p>It was a disappointment, no doubt; and yet
somehow the sight of the ring had given Ralph a
little hope. It was the wedding-ring, he said to
himself, his great-grandmother's wedding-ring.
The Major must have been fond of her to have
had her ring always about him; and it had been
buried with him. That had given rise to the story
about the ruby. He drove home, after giving
directions about the disposal of the coffins, feeling
less sore at heart. He was now convinced that
they had right on their side, and there was some
comfort in that.</p>

<p>When he reached home, he shewed the ring to
Maggie, who agreed with his conclusions.</p>

<p>'But there is something inside&mdash;some letters, I
think,' she cried.</p>

<p>'It is only the Hall-mark,' said Ralph, having
looked in his turn. 'But stop. That tells us
something: it will give us a date.'</p>

<p>'How can that be?' asked Maggie.</p>

<p>'Because there is a different mark every year.
See! you can make it out with a magnifying-glass.
King George in a pigtail.'</p>

<p>The silversmith at Gigglesham turned up his
tabulated list of Hall-marks, and told them at
once the date of the ring&mdash;1760.</p>

<p>'But it might have been made a long time before
it was first used,' suggested Maggie.</p>

<p>'True; but it could not have been used before it
was made,' replied Ralph. 'It gives us a date
approximately, at all events.'</p>

<p>At first, the knowledge of this date did not seem
likely to be of much use to them. But it gave
them the heart to go on and make further inquiries.
Ralph threw himself into the task with
fervour. He obtained leave to search the records
of the Horse Guards; and ascertained at last where
had been stationed the regiment that Richard
Hammond then belonged to in that same year.</p>

<p>It was at Canterbury, as it happened; and that
seemed significant, for it was not so far from there
to his sweetheart's home at Milton. Ralph went
over to Canterbury, and with the help of a clerk
of Mr Smith's, searched all the parish registers
between the two places; but found nothing.</p>

<p>The trial was coming on in a few weeks, and
not a scrap of evidence could they get of the
marriage of Major Hammond. The other side
were full of confidence, and well they might be.
Ralph had made up his mind to return home, and
was walking disconsolately down the High Street
of Canterbury one day when he saw over a shop-window
the sign, '<span class="smcap">Pilgrim</span>, Goldsmith; established
1715.'</p>

<p>'I wonder,' he said to himself, 'if my great-grandfather
bought his wedding-ring there?'</p>

<p>A sudden impulse sent him into the shop. A
nice-looking old gentleman, with long white hair,
was sitting behind the counter, peering into the
works of a watch through an elongated eye-glass.</p>

<p>Ralph brought out his ring. 'Do you think
this ring was bought at your shop?' he asked.</p>

<p>'How long ago?' asked Mr Pilgrim, taking up
the ring and looking at it all round.</p>

<p>'About the year 1760.'</p>

<p>'Ah-h! I can't remember so long ago as that. It
was in my father's time; but for all that, perhaps
I can tell you.'</p>

<p>He took up the magnifying-glass, and examined
the ring carefully once more.</p>

<p>'Yes,' he said, looking up, a mysterious expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">{620}</a></span>
on his face, 'that ring was bought from my
father, I have no doubt.'</p>

<p>Ralph questioned him as to the sources of his
knowledge; and Mr Pilgrim told him at last. It
was his father's practice to put his private mark
upon all the jewellery he sold. He could do it in
those days, when his stock was small and all his
own. In these times of changing fashions, when
much of a jeweller's stock is on approval, this
would be impossible.</p>

<p>Ralph listened to these explanations with breathless
impatience. Had Mr Pilgrim any books belonging
to his father which might possibly shew
the sale? The old gentleman admitted that he had
a lot of his father's old account-books up in a
garret; but it would be very troublesome to get at
them; and what would be the use?</p>

<p>'Why,' said Ralph, 'you might possibly make
the happiness of two young people, who otherwise
may be sundered all their lives.' He explained
enough of the circumstances to shew the old
gentleman that it was not an affair of mere idle
curiosity; and after that he entered into the quest
with ardour. Pilgrim his father had kept each
year a sort of rough day-book, in which he entered
transactions as they occurred, with occasional short
annotations. And at last, after a long troublesome
search, they found the book for the year 1760 and
1761. Nothing was to be made of the first; but in
the second they had the delight of finding the
following entry: '25 March, sold ring, young
Master Hammond, two guineas saw y<sup>e</sup> wedding
afterwards at St Mary's, Faversham.'</p>

<p>That night all the church bells of Gigglesham
were set a-ringing, for the news oozed out that
Ralph Grant had come home with full proofs of
the marriage that would make good his title to
Westbury. For the young people were liked by
everybody, whilst Boodles was generally execrated.
Indeed the case never came on for trial, as
Boodles withdrew the record when he found that
there was full evidence to refute his claim. Ralph
and Maggie were married soon afterwards; and the
bride wore as a keeper over the golden circle her
own special dower, the long-buried but happily
recovered treasure, Major Hammond's ring.</p>

<h2><a name="LOST_IN_MAGELLANS_STRAITS" id="LOST_IN_MAGELLANS_STRAITS">LOST IN MAGELLAN'S STRAITS.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> might look all the world over without finding
a coast more bleak, desolate, and inhospitable than
that of Tierra del Fuego and the southern part of
Patagonia. Owing to certain meteorological causes,
the cold is comparatively greater in the southern
than in the northern latitudes; icebergs are found
ten degrees nearer to the equator. In the Straits
of Magellan, which are about the same distance
from the equator as Central England, the cold in
winter is so intense as to be almost unbearable.
Here icebergs are found floating, and glaciers
larger in extent than any Switzerland can boast
of; the land is entirely covered with snow down
to the very water's edge, while bitter piercing
winds rush down the clefts in the mountains,
carrying everything before them, and even tearing
up huge trees in their passage. Not a pleasant
coast this on which to be cast away; and yet such,
in 1867, was the fate of two unfortunate men who
formed part of the crew of Her Majesty's ship
<i>Chanticleer</i>, then on the Pacific station; and an
account of whose sufferings we propose to lay
before our readers.</p>

<p>One day early in September a sailing-party had
been sent off with the hope of increasing the ship's
stock of provisions by the addition of fresh fish,
which is here very abundant. The nets soon
became so heavy that extra hands were required to
haul them; and as there appeared even then little
chance of the work being over before sunset, the
fishing-party obtained permission to spend the
night on shore. Tents were pitched, huge fires
were lighted, with the double object of affording
warmth and cooking some of the produce of their
successful expedition; blankets were distributed,
grog was served out, and altogether the party
seemed prepared to defy the cold, shewing a disposition
to be 'jolly' in spite of it that would
have gladdened the soul of the immortal Mark
Tapley. However, after all these preparations to
keep off the effects of the biting frost, they were
compelled about nine o'clock in the evening to
send off to the ship for more blankets and provisions.</p>

<p>Two sailors, Henty and Riddles, volunteered to
go on this errand in the 'dingy' (a small two-oared
boat), and having obtained the desired things,
they started to return; but when about midway
between the ship and the shore, the wind began to
rise, carrying the boat to some extent out of her
course; shortly after which she struck on a sand-bank,
and in trying to get her off one of the oars
was lost. Soon they were drifted out into the
strong current. It was now dark as pitch; the wind
continued to rise; and although all through the
night they made every possible effort to reach the
shore, when morning dawned, to their alarm they
found themselves miles away from the ship, and
powerless to contend any longer with their one
oar against the force of both wind and tide. They
were finally driven on to the beach in a bay opposite
Port Famine, a spot not less dreary than its
name.</p>

<p>The sea was so rough, that here for a day and a
night our two men were obliged to remain; and
when on the second day they ventured to launch
the boat, it was upset; nearly all their things were
lost, and they were left to endure the intense cold
without the means of making a fire, with no
clothes but those they wore, and scarcely any
food. For a while they walked about, trying,
not very successfully, to keep up circulation;
and by-and-by the feet of both began to swell
and grow so painful that it was no longer
possible to keep on their shoes. Still, although
suffering both from hunger and cold (Henty's
toes being already frost-bitten), they kept up their
spirits in true British fashion, not for a minute
doubting that sooner or later they would be picked
up; and true enough, on the fourth day the <i>Chanticleer</i>
was seen in the distance under weigh, and
standing over towards them. Taking the most
prominent position that could be found, they
made signs and tried in every possible way to
attract attention, but in vain. If they had only
possessed some means of kindling a fire they might
have succeeded; but although those on board were
at the moment on the look-out for their lost mess-mates,
no one saw them; and the hope with which
the two poor fellows had buoyed themselves up,
faded away as the ship changed her course, grew
smaller and smaller, and by-and-by, late in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">{621}</a></span>
afternoon, while they still watched, altogether
disappeared.</p>

<p>Although now their only chance of rescue was
apparently gone, and the last scrap of food was
consumed, yet the brave fellows did not despair.
Their boat was very leaky; but on the 5th of
September, having repaired her as far as possible,
they took advantage of finer weather to endeavour
to reach some spot where there would be more
probability of getting rescued by a passing ship;
but they had scarcely got half-way across the
Straits before there was a terrific snow-storm; it
blew a gale; the boat began to fill rapidly; and
finally they were blown back again into the bay,
upset in the surf and nearly drowned, being unable
to swim through having lost the use of their legs
from sitting so long in water. However, they
were thrown up by the waves high, though by
no means dry, and in this miserable plight and
under a pitiless snow-storm, they were forced to
remain all through the night. The next day they
managed to erect something in the form of a hut,
in which they might lie down and be to some
extent protected from the weather, which was so
boisterous as to render it useless to attempt to
launch the boat. For some days, owing to exposure
and want of food, they were both very ill;
but still hoping for better weather, they kept themselves
alive by eating sea-weed and such shell-fish
as could be found, until the 12th of September,
when the weather suddenly clearing, they again
launched their small boat; and this time, after a
day's hard toil, succeeded in reaching the opposite
side of the Straits, where they had left the ship,
which it is needless to say was by this time far
away.</p>

<p>When first the men were missed, rockets had
been fired, and blue-lights burned; and on the
following day the cutter was sent to the westward,
while the <i>Chanticleer</i> coasted along the opposite
side; look-out men were constantly aloft; but
nothing was to be seen of the missing men. The
next day the ship had remained at Port Famine,
and exploring parties were sent in all directions.
On the third day they again weighed anchor, and
examined a fresh piece of coast, but all to no purpose;
and finally it was decided, with much regret,
to give up the search, for every one concluded that
the poor men must by this time have perished,
even if they had survived the first night's cold,
which no one on board thought possible. Both
men were generally popular, and great grief was
felt for their loss. Immediately a subscription
was started by the whole ship's company for the
widow of the one man and the mother of the
other. Strangely enough, when the sad news
reached England, the former, in spite of what
seemed conclusive evidence, firmly refused to
believe the assurance of her husband's death.
Whether the wife's intuition or the more logical
inferences of every one else proved correct, events
will shew.</p>

<p>By the time Henty and Riddles reached, as we
have seen, the opposite side of the Straits it was
quite dark; but on the following day they found
that the current had drifted them fourteen miles
from Port Famine, towards which they had steered,
and for which place they now started on foot.
Here they saw in the distance a ship under steam
going towards the Pacific; but again all efforts to
attract attention failed. They knew of no settlement
that they could hope to reach, and at this
rough season there was not the slightest chance of
falling in with any wandering tribes of natives.
The only course left them was to endure the cold,
wait as patiently as might be, in the hope of some
ship passing within hail, and to keep up what
little life remained in them by chewing sea-weed,
and seeking and devouring the mussels, which
fortunately were to be found in great abundance
on the rocks. After a time, however, they grew so
weak as to be only just able to crawl out of the
place they had made to lie down in, and every
day the effort to gather their scanty nourishment
grew harder. Once more, on the 4th of October,
they saw a vessel pass through the Straits, but
were unable to make any signals; on the 7th, both
men had grown too weak to stir, and nothing was
left for them but to confront death. The 8th
day passed, the 9th, the 10th, and they were
still sinking slowly from starvation. On the
11th, when they could not possibly have lived
more than a few hours longer, and had become
little short of living skeletons, they were picked
up by the officers of the <i>Shearwater</i>, and at once
taken on board, where, after receiving the most
careful attention, both, although still suffering
greatly, began after a time to recover. Being conveyed
by the <i>Shearwater</i> to Rio, they remained
some time in the hospital there, and finally were
sent home invalided; and yet both men lived to
regain their full strength, and to serve as striking
examples of what tough human nature can endure
in the shape of physical hardships and mental
anxiety. They had contrived, by a patience and
energy almost unprecedented, to lengthen out
existence for a space considerably over a month,
with no other food than sea-weed and shell-fish;
the last four days indeed eating absolutely nothing;
while the whole time exposed to intense cold, the
roughest weather, and more hardships than it is
possible for those who have never seen that barren
and desolate region even to imagine.</p>

SCIENCE AND ARTS.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr T. M. Reade</span>, in his presidential address to the
Liverpool Geological Society, discussed the question
of 'geological time,' and took as an approximate
measure thereof the denuding effect of rain-water
on the earth's surface. The most rainy districts in
England are those in which the oldest rocks prevail;
but the average annual rainfall, including
Wales, may be taken at 32 inches. Assuming the
area of the two to represent one river basin, the
quantity of water discharged in a year would contain
more than eight million tons of solid matters;
and at this rate, 12,978 years would be required to
lower the surface of the land one foot. Analyses
of sea-water shew that there are in 100,000 tons,
48 tons of carbonate of lime and magnesia, and
1017 tons of sulphate of lime and magnesia; and
the ocean contains enough of the first to cover the
whole of the land with a layer fifteen feet thick;
and of the second to make a layer 267 feet thick.
Twenty-five million years would be required to
accumulate the one, and 480,000 years the other.
Again, the total surface of the globe is 197 million<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">{622}</a></span>
square miles. A cubic mile of rock would weigh
10,903,552,000 tons; so that, as Mr Reade states,
'to cover the whole surface of the globe one mile
deep with sediment from the land at the rate of
800 tons per square mile of land-surface, would
take 52,647,052 years.'</p>

<p>Geologists have speculated over this question
many years: it has now passed into the hands of
mathematicians, without whose aid it will never be
settled. The Rev. Dr Haughton, F.R.S., of Trinity
College, Dublin, in a paper read before the Royal
Society on the last evening of their session, 'On
the probable age of the continent of Asia and
Europe, and on the absolute measure of geological
time,' says that the elevation of Asia and Europe
from beneath the deep waters, separated the earth's
axis of rotation from the axis of figure by 207
miles, which would produce a large amount of
wabbling. At present, 'astronomers are agreed
that the motion of the pole is secular and very
slow, all traces of wabbling having disappeared.'
Then after a series of mathematical demonstrations,
the doctor continues: 'The geological age of the
continent of Asia and Europe is well marked by
the horizon of the Nummulitic Limestones,' which
extend from the Mediterranean to Japan. 'These
rocks make up the backbone of the great continent,
and at its formation were raised from deep water
to form the highest chains of mountains in the
globe. Geologically speaking, they are modern,
belonging to the Lower Tertiary Period. My calculations
assign to the Nummulitic Epoch a date
not less than 4157 millions of years ago. No
practical geologist will feel any surprise at this
result.'</p>

<p>In a paper read at the last meeting of the Geological
Society, Mr Belt discussed various geological
questions, and shewed reasons for believing
that in the far remote ages, the north of Europe
was covered by a great lake. 'The formation of
this lake was due,' he remarked, 'to the ice of the
glacial period flowing down the beds of the
Atlantic and Pacific, and damming back the drainage
of the continents as far as it extended. To the
rising of these waters must be ascribed the destruction
of palÃ¦olithic man, the mammoth, and the
woolly rhinoceros. This lake was once suddenly
and torrentially discharged through the breaking
away of the Atlantic ice-dam, but was formed
again and ultimately drained by the cutting through
of the channel of the Bosphorus.' It is perhaps
well to remark that these views are not as yet
implicitly accepted.</p>

<p>In the Eocene deposits of New Mexico a fossil
bone of a gigantic bird has been found, which, according
to the description, had 'feet twice the bulk of
those of the ostrich.' This discovery proves that
huge birds formed part of the primeval fauna of
North America, and that they were not confined
exclusively to the southern hemisphere.</p>

<p>Professor Kirkwood states, in a paper on the
relative ages of the sun and certain fixed stars
read to the American Philosophical Society, that
the history of the solar system is comprised within
twenty or thirty millions of years; that our solar
system is more advanced in its history than the
constellation of the Centaur, and that the companion
of Sirius appears to have reached a stage
of greater maturity than the sun, while the contrary
seems to be true in regard to the principal
star.</p>

<p>The annual report on the great trigonometrical
survey of India contains particulars which shew
that surveying in India is by no means holiday
pastime. Colonel Montgomerie, who has just
retired after twenty-five years' service, was engaged
during nine of those years in a survey of the
dominions of the Maharaja of Kashmir, comprising
about 77,000 square miles. Within this extensive
area rise stupendous mountain ranges and peaks,
the highest of which is more than 28,000 feet, and
the Indus, Jhelum, Kishanganga, and other great
rivers, flow through the valleys. To fix the position
of heights and places in such a country requires a
combination of courage, skill, and endurance rarely
to be met with, but which happily for geographical
science has been forthcoming ever since
the Indian survey was commenced. The annual
reports contain many accounts of adventurous
journeys, and hazardous exploits which few readers
would think of looking for among the dry details
of a scientific triangulation. Sometimes on resuming
work after the rainy season, the 'rays' or lanes
which had been cut through the forest to clear a
way for taking distant sights, would be found so
choked by the shoots from tree-stumps and young
bamboos which had grown to an 'astonishing
height,' that more than thirty miles of such rays
had to be cleared over again before the work could
proceed. On extending the survey into Burmah
it was only by cutting tracks through the dense
forest that communications could be effected from
station to station, and whenever an existing road
could be made available it was regarded as a
luxury. At KamÃ¡kabo it became necessary to
carry the great theodolite to the top of a rocky
hill: the sharp projecting rocks 'jutted out in
every direction,' and as they could not be removed,
ladders were stretched from rock to rock, and thus
a most perilous ascent and descent was accomplished.
The labour and risk may be judged of
from the fact that the theodolite weighed more
than six hundred pounds, and we can appreciate
the satisfaction with which the observer wrote in
his journal, 'it was a day of rejoicing when the
instrument was brought down in safety.' At times
a region of sand-hills was traversed where vision
was not obstructed, but where not more than
three wells of drinkable water were found in a
distance of seventy miles. And once the observer
waded through a mile of mud and water under a
burning sun to an old lighthouse whence it was
essential to take angles to fix the position of the
new one five miles distant. A consequence of this
exploit was an attack of malarious fever.</p>

<p>It seems likely that trigonometrical surveying
may be carried on with less difficulty in future;
for an Italian officer of engineers, Lieutenant
Manzi, has proved that the triangulations can be
photographed. It is possible to construct a camera
geometrically arranged, and if the rays of light
converging from distant points of view are intercepted,
and marked on a diaphragm, it is evident
that the angular readings obtained to such points
would be identical in their bearings with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">{623}</a></span>
objects themselves. By such a camera, negative
views of inaccessible ground can be faithfully
taken, and the angles can be either plotted or
calculated. Photography thus offers itself as a
means whereby a difficult mountain country can
be surveyed without risk, while for purposes of
military recognisance its advantages are obvious.</p>

<p>For some time past attention has been directed
towards steel-wire cables; and experiments recently
made in Portsmouth Dockyard have clearly demonstrated
their superiority over hemp and iron.
Steel, as is well known, is more and more used in
the building of ships, and, because of its tenacity
and lightness, in their rigging; and now it seems
likely to supersede the unwieldy hawsers and chain
cables everywhere in use. With a chain the safety
of the ship depends on the weakest welding; and
when a single link parts, either from inherent
defect or from a sudden jerk, everything parts,
and the vessel drifts. A wire cable, on the contrary,
gives notice, so to speak, of an approach to
the breaking point. First one strand, then another,
gives way, and still the cable holds, and it may
happen that it will hold long enough to save the
ship. Now that experiment has proved that a
steel-wire cable is as flexible as the best hemp, that
it is three times as strong, and does not cost more,
the change from one to the other may be made
with confidence. Another advantage is the lightness,
for by making use of steel, about two-thirds
of the usual weight of the cable is got rid of.
Evidence of the strength is seen in the fact that a
three-inch steel hawser did not break until the
strain exceeded twenty-two tons, and that a strain
of more than a hundred tons was required to break
the six-inch.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Totten of the United States Army,
in writing about explosives and big guns, discusses
carefully the question as to the best kind of explosive
for actual service; that which will expend
its entire force in driving out the projectile. With
the large-grained gunpowder now in use about
half of the charge is wasted, while gun-cotton and
dynamite exert an injurious strain upon the gun.
As a way out of the difficulty, he recommends a
'compensating powder,' each grain of which contains
a core of gun-cotton, and he points out that
forty pounds of this powder would be sixty pounds
stronger than a hundred-pound charge of gunpowder.
The explanation is that by the time forty pounds
of the hundred are burned, the shot has left the
gun; consequently, sixty pounds are of no help
to the shot. But if the forty pounds contain fifteen
pounds of gun-cotton, then this cotton, when fired,
acts on the already moving shot under the most
favourable circumstances as a pure accelerator, and
does not injure the gun. In this way, writes
Lieutenant Totten, 'we eliminate the great waste
of the one, curb the straining action of both, and
obtain a true artillery powder, lighter, and four
and a half times more effective, charge for charge,
than our best gunpowder.'</p>

<p>An address 'On Light in some of its Relations
to Disease,' delivered to the Albany Institute
(State of New York) by Dr Stevens, sets forth
views and facts which are worth consideration.
Light, as we know, is on the whole beneficial; but
may there not be cases in which it is harmful when
passing through the transparent media of the
human eye? Dr Stevens is clearly of opinion that
many nervous diseases are aggravated if not produced
by defective vision. The strain on the
muscles of the eye, when long continued, sets up
an irritability which tells injuriously on the nervous
system, and neuralgic affections. St Vitus's
dance and severe periodical headaches are the consequence.
Rectify the imperfection of the sight,
says Dr Stevens, by proper spectacles, and the nervous
disease will be either mitigated or cured. It is
of no use to buy glasses at hazard because they seem
to suit the eye; for none but a scientific oculist
can really decide, after careful experiment, on what
is proper. In many cases the focus of the two
eyes is not the same, and each must have its
proper glass. Professor Donders of Utrecht was
the first to point out that the so-called 'cylindrical
glasses' were generally the most efficient; and
since then 'the science of correcting anomalous
refractions of the eye has been brought to a perfection
which is truly wonderful.'</p>

<p>Dr Poumeau of Guadeloupe has published a
series of tables, based on the changes of the moon,
by which, as he believes, it is possible to tell the
sex of a child before birth. He intends to draw
up similar tables for the use of horse and cattle
breeders; and if any one should test his calculations
by observation, the doctor would like to be
informed of the result.</p>

<p>The <i>Journal</i> of the Chemical Society contains an
account by Mr Hight, of the Indian Forest Department,
of experiments made with a view to ascertain
the practical nature of a proposed method of
determining the mineral strength of soils by means
of water-culture. It is explained that the usual
object of water-culture experiments is to find what
particular salts are congenial or necessary to the
growth of any particular plant. When a plant is
grown in an artificially prepared solution, so that
it can obtain its nourishment solely from the salts
contained in that solution, the exact effect of any
salt upon the growth of the plant can be easily
observed by adding that salt to, or abstracting it
from the solution. In carrying out this method,
specimens of soil were taken from five different
forests in India; solutions of these specimens were
made; seedlings of <i>Acacia arabica</i> were, with
proper precautions, placed in each, and the results
of growth, such as increase in weight, number of
leaves, and length of roots, were carefully noted.
These results are published in a numerical table,
and allowing for the difficulties of a preliminary
experiment, may be regarded as satisfactory.</p>

<p>The question is frequently asked&mdash;Why is there
no School of Forestry in England, while in almost
all other countries of Europe schools of forest
science are either established by the government,
or are associated with a university or a polytechnic
institution? Sir Joseph Hooker, President of the
Royal Society, and Director of the Royal Gardens,
Kew, says in one of his reports, that the subject is
so neglected in this country, that when our government
are in want of a forest inspector for India,
they have first to send him to France or Germany
to learn the theory and practice of taking care of a
forest. On the continent, as Sir Joseph remarks,
'forestry holds a distinguished place among the
branches of a liberal education. In the estimation
of an average Briton, forests are of infinitely less
importance than the game they shelter, and it is
not long since the wanton destruction of a fine
young tree was considered a venial offence compared
with the snaring of a pheasant or rabbit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">{624}</a></span>
Wherever the English rule extends, with the
exception of India, the same apathy, or at least
inaction, prevails. In South Africa, according to
the colonial botanist's report, millions of acres
have been made desert, and more are being made
desert annually, through the destruction of the
indigenous forests; in Demarara the useful timber
trees have all been removed from accessible regions,
and no care or thought is given to planting others;
from Trinidad we have the same story; in New
Zealand there is not now a good Kauri pine to be
found near the coast, and I believe that the annals
of almost every English colony would repeat the
tale of wilful wanton waste and improvidence. On
the other hand in France, Germany, Switzerland,
Austria, and Russia, the forests and waste lands
are the subjects of devoted attention on the part
of the government, and colleges, provided with a
complete staff of accomplished professors, train
youths of good birth and education to the duties
of state foresters. Nor, in the case of France, is
this practice confined to the mother country: the
Algerian forests are worked with scrupulous solicitude,
and the collections of vegetable produce from
the French colonies in the permanent museum at
Paris contain specimens which abundantly testify
that their forests are all diligently explored.'</p>

<p>This is a long quotation; but it is justified by
the importance of the subject, and it is quite
clear that we cannot go on much longer without a
School of Forestry. Diligent students can hardly
fail to be forthcoming, and when once they shall
have proved themselves efficient inspectors, the
question of 'good' birth may be left to take care
of itself.</p>

<span class="i0">And conjure up vague theories of the past;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here a hand to trace; and there to lose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The touch of human life upon it cast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still for idle loitering make excuse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And weave a tale of mystery to the last;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the old deserted garden bowers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Find fairer blossoms than 'mongst tended flowers.<br /></span>
